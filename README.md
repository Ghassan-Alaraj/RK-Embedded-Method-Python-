# RK-Embedded-Method-Python-
A script file, that solves an ODE systems using any user inputted embedded RK method and adaptive time stepping.

The example file, uses Bogcaki 3rd order method to solve a system of odes.

The system has 3 solutions: r(t) corresponds to the rabbit population, c(t) the carrot population, and f(t) the fox population.
a1, a2, b1, b2, d1, d2 are model parameters that pretain to the compition that each population expreiences and the reproduction rate of each population.
